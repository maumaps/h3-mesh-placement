Population clustering (`call mesh_population()`) timed out twice (5 min and 15 min) on the current dataset; no `population` towers were inserted.
Needs investigation/optimization before running end-to-end.
mesh_visibility_edges_refresh() runs longer than 10 minutes; two attempts timed out and were cancelled, so mesh_visibility_edges still reflects the previous seed set and lacks Jvari edges.
